    <p>Git is a version checking tool commonly used in the CS industry.
        It allows companies to maintain a "main" body of code while giving 
        engineers permission to "pull" code from the main branch to tweak. If 
        they do tweak the code, they must then add it back to the main branch
        in the following manner. 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Add:</strong> By adding the new file to the "commit" list,
        the computer then knows to add it to the local main branch. This is 
        done using the command <strong>git add [FILE NAME]</strong> 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Commit:</strong> Committing just adds any new files (or any 
        modified files) to the local main branch. It is done with the command
        <strong>git commit -m"[CHANGELOG]"</strong>. The strength of git comes 
        with the included changelog, where you can detail what you changed in 
        the code (or what the code is). This way, any new commit (whether it be
        a new body of code or just an edit of existing code) can be easily and 
        quickly categorized. the -m is an important flag as well in the ssh 
        code, but explaining it escapes the scope of this current document. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Push:</strong> A push request is a request to push all files on 
        the local main branch to the global main branch (for example, a company
        that asks you to change something will have a main branch in their 
        repository, and after you change something you would need to add your 
        code back to the main repository.)
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can check the status of your local github branches with the command 
        <strong>git status</strong>. 
    </p>
    <p>As another note, you do need to create some repository URL that connects
        your initialized git instance on your machine to the repository you are 
        working from.
    </p>
